                    <ul>
                        <li>Limit permissions to individuals to only what is necessary the users requirements. 
                            This makes a compromised account less of an issue, as you can contain the data that can be viewed and the changes to the system that could have been made. 
                            This could be done in layers of access.</li>
                        <li>Dedicated teams looking into threats, flaws and possible vulnerabilities. 
                            These issues are commonly talked about and shared and their mitigations are often published beside their discovery. 
                            There should also be teams that go along with these to implement fixes and remove malware.</li>
                        <li>Teams can be tasked with attempting to break the system and break into accounts, this can show weaknesses in a way that they can be sure it isn’t going to be in malicious hands.</li>
                        <li>There should be standards for password creation that make attacks such as brute force difficult to impossible to attempt.</li>
                    </ul>
